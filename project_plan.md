# Data Visualization for Cross-Modal Plasticity

This document outlines the plan for implementing interactive visualizations demonstrating how the visual cortex can be activated by auditory stimuli, with simulations of neural pathway rewiring based on the scientific paper "Through the Ear, We See: A Neuroadaptive Blueprint for Non-Invasive Vision Restoration via Auditory Interfaces."

## Project Goals

1. Create interactive visualizations of brain regions involved in cross-modal plasticity
2. Simulate neural pathway rewiring between auditory and visual cortices
3. Demonstrate how auditory stimuli can activate visual processing areas
